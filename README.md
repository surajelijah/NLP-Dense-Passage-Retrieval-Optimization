# NLP-Dense-Passage-Retrieval-Optimization
 Tried to Implement and improve the Facebook Paper on Dense Passage Retrieval

- Answered the question posed at the start of the presentation - provided an efficient dense representation for question passage pairs without pretraining
- Outperformed and potentially could replace the traditional sparse retrieval component in open-domain question answering
- As a result of improved retrieval performance, they obtained new state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain question answering benchmarks.
